This is the code repository for [Game Development Patterns with Unity 2021-Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/game-development-patterns-with-unity-2021-second-edition/9781800200814), published by Packt.

**Explore practical game development using industry design patterns and best practices in Unity and C#**

## What is this book about?
Unity has a particular coding model and architecture that requires knowledge of common software design patterns. This means that to be able to optimally code a game in Unity in the same way you do in other engines, you'll have to adapt to programming techniques including design patterns.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Structure your Unity code using industry-standard development patterns to make it look professional
* Identify the right patterns for implementing specific game mechanics or features
* Develop configurable core game mechanics and ingredients that can be modified without writing a single line of code
* Review practical OOP techniques and learn how they're used in the context of a Unity project
* Build unique game development systems such as a level editor

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter05.

The code will look like the following:
```
using UnityEngine;

namespace Chapter.State
{
    public class BikeStopState : MonoBehaviour, IBikeState
    {
        private BikeController _bikeController; 
        
        public void Handle(BikeController bikeController)
        {
            if (!_bikeController)
                _bikeController = bikeController;

            _bikeController.CurrentSpeed = 0;
        }
    }
}
```
